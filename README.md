# RabbitMQ Cluster Kubernetes Operator

Manage [RabbitMQ](https://www.rabbitmq.com/) clusters deployed to [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/). The RabbitMQ Cluster Kubernetes Operator has been built using the [Kubebuilder](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kubebuilder) implementation of the [operator pattern](https://coreos.com/blog/introducing-operators.html). This repository contains a [custom controller](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/api-extension/custom-resources/#custom-controllers) and [custom resource definition (CRD)](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/api-extension/custom-resources/#customresourcedefinitions) designed for the lifecyle (creation, upgrade, graceful shutdown) of a RabbitMQ cluster.

**Note**: this repository is under active development and is provided as **beta** software. Official support for this software is not provided; if you encounter any issues running this software, please feel free to [contribute to the project](#contributing).

## Supported Versions

The operator deploys RabbitMQ `3.8.5`, and requires a Kubernetes cluster of `1.16` or `1.17`.
`RabbitmqCluster` CRD cannot be installed in a Kubernetes `1.18` cluster because of a schema validation that ensures that properties defined as `list-map-keys` must either be required or have a default value ([related github issue](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/91395)).

## Quickstart

### Deploying on KinD

The easiest way to set up a local development environment for running the RabbitMQ operator is using [KinD](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/):

1. Follow the KinD [installation guide](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/#installation-and-usage) to deploy a Kubernetes cluster
1. Ensure that all [Required environment variables](#required-environment-variables) are set in your environment
1. Run `make deploy-kind`
1. Check that the operator is running by running `kubectl get all --namespace=rabbitmq-system`
1. Deploy a `RabbitmqCluster` custom resource. Refer to the [example YAML](./cr-example.yaml) and [documentation](https://docs.pivotal.io/rabbitmq-kubernetes/0-7/using.html#configure) for available CR attributes
    1. Due to resource limitations on your Docker daemon, the Kubernetes might not be able to schedule all `RabbitmqCluster` nodes. Either [increase your Docker daemon's resource limits](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/#resources) or deploy the `RabbitmqCluster` custom resource with `resources: {}` to remove default `memory` and `cpu` resource settings.
    1. If you set the `serviceType` to `LoadBalancer`, run `make kind-prepare` to deploy a [MetalLB](https://metallb.universe.tf/) load balancer. This will allow the operator to complete the `RabbitmqCluster` provisioning by assign an arbitrary local IP address to the cluster's client service. Proper [network configuration](https://metallb.universe.tf/installation/network-addons/) is required to route traffic via the assigned IP address.


## Documentation

RabbitMQ Cluster Kubernetes Operator is covered by several guides:

 - [Operator overview](https://www.rabbitmq.com/kubernetes/operator/operator-overview.html)
 - [Deploying an operator](https://www.rabbitmq.com/kubernetes/operator/install-operator.html)
 - [Deploying a RabbitMQ cluster](https://www.rabbitmq.com/kubernetes/operator/using-operator.html)
 - [Monitoring the cluster](https://www.rabbitmq.com/kubernetes/operator/operator-monitoring.html)
 - [Troubleshooting operator deployments](https://www.rabbitmq.com/kubernetes/operator/troubleshooting-operator.html)

In addition, a number of [examples](./docs/examples) can be found in this repository.

The doc guides are open source. The source can be found in the [RabbitMQ website repository](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-website/)
under `site/kubernetes`.


## Makefile

#### Required environment variables

- DOCKER_REGISTRY_SERVER: URL of docker registry containing the Operator image (e.g. `registry.my-company.com`)
- DOCKER_REGISTRY_USERNAME: Username for accessing the docker registry
- DOCKER_REGISTRY_PASSWORD: Password for accessing the docker registry
- DOCKER_REGISTRY_SECRET: Name of Kubernetes secret in which to store the Docker registry username and password
- OPERATOR_IMAGE: path to the Operator image within the registry specified in DOCKER_REGISTRY_SERVER (e.g. `rabbitmq/cluster-operator`). Note: OPERATOR_IMAGE should **not** include a leading slash (`/`)

- **destroy** Cleanup all operator artefacts
- **kind-prepare** Prepare KinD to support LoadBalancer services, and local-path StorageClass
- **kind-unprepare** Remove KinD support for LoadBalancer services, and local-path StorageClass
- **list** List Makefile targets

This project follows the typical GitHub pull request model. Before starting any work, please either comment on an [existing issue](https://github.com/pivotal/rabbitmq-for-kubernetes/issues), or file a new one.

### Testing

Before submitting a pull request, ensure all local tests pass:
- `make unit-tests`
- `make integration-tests`

<!-- TODO: generalise deployment process: make DOCKER_REGISTRY_SECRET and DOCKER_REGISTRY_SERVER configurable -->
Also, run the system tests with your local changes against a Kubernetes cluster:
- `make deploy-dev`
- `make system-tests`
