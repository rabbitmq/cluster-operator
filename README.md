# RabbitMQ Cluster Kubernetes Operator

Kubernetes operator to deploy and manage [RabbitMQ](https://www.rabbitmq.com/) clusters. This repository contains a [custom controller](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/api-extension/custom-resources/#custom-controllers) and [custom resource definition (CRD)](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/api-extension/custom-resources/#customresourcedefinitions) designed for the lifecyle (creation, upgrade, graceful shutdown) of a RabbitMQ cluster.

**Note**: this repository is under active development and is provided as **beta** software. Official support for this software is not provided; if you encounter any issues running this software, please feel free to [contribute to the project](#contributing).

## Quickstart

If you have a running Kubernetes cluster and `kubectl` configured to access it, run the following command to install the operator:

```bash
kubectl apply -f https://github.com/rabbitmq/cluster-operator/releases/latest/download/cluster-operator.yml
```

Then you can deploy a RabbitMQ cluster:

```bash
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rabbitmq/cluster-operator/main/docs/examples/hello-world/rabbitmq.yaml
```
