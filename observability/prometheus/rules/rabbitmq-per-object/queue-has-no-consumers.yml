          Over the last 10 minutes, non-empty queue `{{ $labels.queue }}` with {{ $value }} messages
          in virtual host `{{ $labels.vhost }}` didn't have any consumers in
          RabbitMQ cluster `{{ $labels.rabbitmq_cluster }}` in namespace `{{ $labels.namespace }}`.
        summary: |
          Messages are sitting idle in the queue, without any processing.
          This alert is highly application specific (and e.g. doesn't make sense for stream queues).
