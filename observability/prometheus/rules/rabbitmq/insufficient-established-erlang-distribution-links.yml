        description: |
          There are only `{{ $value }}` established Erlang distribution links
          in RabbitMQ cluster `{{ $labels.rabbitmq_cluster }}` in namespace `{{ $labels.namespace }}`.
        summary: |
          RabbitMQ clusters have a full mesh topology.
          All RabbitMQ nodes connect to all other RabbitMQ nodes in both directions.
          The expected number of established Erlang distribution links is therefore `n*(n-1)` where `n` is the number of RabbitMQ nodes in the cluster.
          Therefore, the expected number of distribution links are `0` for a 1-node cluster, `6` for a 3-node cluster, and `20` for a 5-node cluster.
          This alert reports that the number of established distributions links is less than the expected number.
          Some reasons for this alert include failed network links, network partitions, failed clustering (i.e. nodes can't join the cluster).
          Check the panels `All distribution links`, `Established distribution links`, `Connecting distributions links`, `Waiting distribution links`, and `distribution links`
          of the Grafana dashboard `Erlang-Distribution`.
          Check the logs of the RabbitMQ nodes: `kubectl -n {{ $labels.namespace }} logs -l app.kubernetes.io/component=rabbitmq,app.kubernetes.io/name={{ $labels.rabbitmq_cluster }}`
