# Upgrade CRD and Controller

## Table of Contents

A table of contents is helpful for quickly jumping to sections of a proposal and for highlighting
any additional information provided beyond the standard proposal template.
[Tools for generating](https://github.com/ekalinin/github-markdown-toc) a table of contents from markdown are available.

## Glossary [WIP]

Refer to the [Cluster API Book Glossary](https://cluster-api.sigs.k8s.io/reference/glossary.html).

If this proposal adds new terms, or defines some, make the changes to the book's glossary when in PR stage.

## Summary

We propose a documented upgrade workflow for the RabbitMQ for Kubernetes CRD, Controller, and Custom Resource instances, to allow users to feel confident that performing an upgrade will not lead to data loss, or significant downtime. We first seek to understand the tools that are available to upgrade these components, and then seek to implement solutions using these tools that will give users a path to upgrade from an older version to a newer one.

## Motivation

- There is currently no workflow to allow users to upgrade the operator
- We do not have semantic versioning to help set initial expectations around upgrades
- We do not know whether we will experience data loss if we upgrade versions that have different API definitions without having a migration path
- At the moment, users will have to upgrade each Custom Resource instance individually

### Goals

Document how to upgrade our three main components: CRD, controller and all CR instances.
- Implement multiple version support in CRD
- Implement multi version migration webhooks in controller
- Have a strategy around how to deal with multiple CRD versions and multiple controllers - should we deploy all versions of the controller and have them reconcile their associated CR instance? Or simply deploy the latest controller and have it handle all CR instances?
- Have a strategy for how to deal with CR instances that have not been upgraded yet - how to stop a newer versioned controller from reconciling an older versioned CR instance

### Non-Goals/Future Work

- Bulk vs granular upgrades of CR instances
- Upgrading RMQ version

## Proposal [WIP]

This is where we get down to the nitty gritty of what the proposal actually is.

- What is the plan for implementing this feature?
- What data model changes, additions, or removals are required?
- Provide a scenario, or example.
- Use diagrams to communicate concepts, flows of execution, and states.

[PlantUML](http://plantuml.com) is the preferred tool to generate diagrams,
place your `.plantuml` files under `images/` and run `make diagrams` from the docs folder.

### User Stories [WIP]

- Detail the things that people will be able to do if this proposal is implemented.
- Include as much detail as possible so that people can understand the "how" of the system.
- The goal here is to make this feel real for users without getting bogged down.

#### Story 1

### Implementation Details/Notes/Constraints [WIP]

- What are some important details that didn't come across above.
- What are the caveats to the implementation?
- Go in to as much detail as necessary here.
- Talk about core concepts and how they releate.

### Risks and Mitigations [WIP]

- What are the risks of this proposal and how do we mitigate? Think broadly.
- How will UX be reviewed and by whom?
- How will security be reviewed and by whom?
- Consider including folks that also work outside the SIG or subproject.

## Alternatives [WIP]

The `Alternatives` section is used to highlight and record other possible approaches to delivering the value proposed by a proposal.

## Additional Details [WIP]

### Test Plan [optional] [WIP]

**Note:** *Section not required until targeted at a release.*

Consider the following in developing a test plan for this enhancement:
- Will there be e2e and integration tests, in addition to unit tests?
- How will it be tested in isolation vs with other components?

No need to outline all of the test cases, just the general strategy.
Anything that would count as tricky in the implementation and anything particularly challenging to test should be called out.

All code is expected to have adequate tests (eventually with coverage expectations).
Please adhere to the [Kubernetes testing guidelines][testing-guidelines] when drafting this test plan.

[testing-guidelines]: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-testing/testing.md

### Graduation Criteria [optional] [WIP]

**Note:** *Section not required until targeted at a release.*

Define graduation milestones.

These may be defined in terms of API maturity, or as something else. Initial proposal should keep
this high-level with a focus on what signals will be looked at to determine graduation.

Consider the following in developing the graduation criteria for this enhancement:
- [Maturity levels (`alpha`, `beta`, `stable`)][maturity-levels]
- [Deprecation policy][deprecation-policy]

Clearly define what graduation means by either linking to the [API doc definition](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/kubernetes-api/#api-versioning),
or by redefining what graduation means.

In general, we try to use the same stages (alpha, beta, GA), regardless how the functionality is accessed.

[maturity-levels]: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api_changes.md#alpha-beta-and-stable-versions
[deprecation-policy]: https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/deprecation-policy/

### Version Skew Strategy [optional] [WIP]

If applicable, how will the component handle version skew with other components? What are the guarantees? Make sure
this is in the test plan.

Consider the following in developing a version skew strategy for this enhancement:
- Does this enhancement involve coordinating behavior in the control plane and in the kubelet? How does an n-2 kubelet without this feature available behave when this feature is used?
- Will any other components on the node change? For example, changes to CSI, CRI or CNI may require updating that component before the kubelet.
