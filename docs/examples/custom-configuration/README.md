# Custom Configuration Example

You can configure RabbitMQ cluster by setting `.spec.rabbitmq.additionalConfig`. It is a multi-line value that will be appended to the `rabbitmq.conf` generated by the operator.

You can deploy this example like this:

```shell
kubectl apply -f rabbitmq.yaml
```

And once deployed, you can check the complete `rabbitmq.conf` file like this:

```shell
kubectl get -o yaml configmap custom-configuration-rabbitmq-server-conf
```

Keep in mind that currently [RabbitMQ image](https://hub.docker.com/_/rabbitmq/) appends a few more lines to the config file and therefore some properties specified in `additionalConfig` could be overridden. This issue will be resolved in the future.
