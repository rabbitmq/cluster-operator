# How to Contribute

We'd love to accept your patches and contributions to this project. There are
just a few small guidelines you need to follow.

## GitHub issues

RabbitMQ for Kubernetes team uses GitHub issues for feature development and bug tracking.
The issues have specific information as to what the feature should do and what problem or
use case is trying to resolve. Bug reports have a description of the actual behaviour and
the expected behaviour, along with repro steps when possible. It is important to provide
repro when possible, as it speeds up the triage and potential fix.

We do not use GitHub issues for questions or support requests. For that purpose, it is better
to use [RabbitMQ mailing list][rmq-users] or [RabbitMQ Slack #kubernetes channel][rabbitmq-slack].

For support questions, we strongly encourage you to provide a way to
reproduce the behavior you're observing, or at least sharing as much
relevant information as possible on the [RabbitMQ users mailing
list][rmq-users]. This would include YAML manifests, Kubernetes version,
RabbitMQ Operator logs and any other relevant information that might help
to diagnose the problem.

## Pull Requests

RabbitMQ Operator project uses pull requests to discuss, collaborate on and accept code contributions.
Pull requests are the primary place of discussing code changes.

Here's the recommended workflow:

 * [Fork the repository][github-fork] or repositories you plan on contributing to. If multiple
   repositories are involved in addressing the same issue, please use the same branch name
   in each repository
 * Create a branch with a descriptive name
 * Make your changes, run tests (usually with `make unit-tests integration-tests system-tests`), commit with a
   [descriptive message][git-commit-msgs], push to your fork
 * Submit pull requests with an explanation what has been changed and **why**
 * We will get to your pull request within one week. Usually within the next day or two you'll get a response.

If what you are going to work on is a substantial change, please first
ask the core team for their opinion on the [RabbitMQ users mailing list][rmq-users].

## Code reviews

All submissions, including submissions by project members, require review. We
use GitHub pull requests for this purpose. Consult
[GitHub Help](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/) for more
information on using pull requests.
